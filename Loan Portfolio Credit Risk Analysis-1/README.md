📊 Loan Portfolio Credit Risk Analysis — Power BI Dashboard

I designed an advanced Power BI credit risk dashboard to help financial institutions identify high-risk loan segments, exposure concentration, and early default signals before they become critical.

✅ Business Problem Solved

Most lenders track performance after defaults happen — but miss early warning signals like debt concentration and leverage buildup.
This dashboard helps answer forward-looking risk questions, such as:

- Which loan segment carries the highest credit risk exposure?

- Are we becoming overexposed to one borrower type or loan purpose?

- Is risk growing faster than loan performance?

🔍 Key Insights Delivered

- $435M total loan exposure analyzed across 39,000+ loans

- Debt Consolidation loans dominate the risk, with the largest exposure + highest leverage (DTI)

- Default risk is rising sharply in late 2021 — exposure is accelerating faster than stability

- 83% of loans are still performing, but risk is heavily concentrated, not diversified
