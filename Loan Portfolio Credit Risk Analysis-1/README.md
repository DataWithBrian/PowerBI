📊 **Loan Portfolio Credit Risk Analysis — Power BI**

I designed an advanced Power BI credit risk dashboard to help financial institutions identify high-risk loan segments, exposure concentration, and early default signals before they become critical.

This project is split into 2 core analytical layers:

✅ **PAGE 1 — Portfolio Exposure Risk Positioning**
Business Problem Solved

Most lenders track performance after defaults happen, but miss early warning signals like debt concentration and leverage buildup. This dashboard answers forward-looking risk questions such as:

- Which loan segment carries the highest credit risk exposure?

- Are we becoming overexposed to one borrower type or loan purpose?

- Is risk growing faster than loan performance?

Key Insights Delivered

- $435M total loan exposure analyzed across 39,000+ loans

- Debt Consolidation loans dominate the risk, with largest exposure + highest leverage (DTI)

- Default risk is rising sharply in late 2021 → exposure increasing faster than stability

- 83% of loans are still performing, but risk is heavily concentrated, not diversified

✅ **PAGE 2 — Borrower Segmentation for Early Risk Detection**
What I Found

Most lenders assume low-income borrowers are highest risk — but the worst default performance didn’t come from low-income borrowers.
It came from Small Business loans.

- Small Business loans default at 25.6%, ~2× the portfolio default avg (13.8%)

- DTI trend analysis showed that income does reduce leverage — DTI falls steadily as income rises — but this did not translate directly into default outcomes. This proves that “low DTI” doesn’t always mean “low risk”.

- Default rates fall as income rises… except the $500k-$999k income bracket where defaults jump to 17.5%

- This shows even high-income earners can be over-leveraged

- Credit Grade is still the strongest pricing trigger → interest rates climb smoothly A~7% → G~22%

- Employment length has minimal impact

Recommended Actions

To reduce concentration risk & silent build-up:

- apply early monitoring triggers on small business purpose loans

- price risk more on purpose + credit grade, not income

- rebalance portfolio mix toward consistently low-risk categories

- diversify away from extremely high-loss purpose segments

This moves lenders from reactive loss reporting → proactive risk prevention.
